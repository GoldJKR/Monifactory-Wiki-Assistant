# External Sources

Last Updated: 2026-02-21
Status: Active

Use this folder for external/supporting source material, separate from canonical documentation.

Alignment source: `docs/PRD.md` and canonical docs in `docs/`.

## Contents
- `sources/external_links.md` — optional further-reading URLs and notes
- `sources/configs/` — minimal, redacted config evidence used to verify claims

## Rules
- Keep entries minimal and attributable.
- Do not store proprietary/vanilla assets or modpack binaries.
- Prefer excerpts over full dumps.
- Mark unverifiable notes as unverified when adding supporting material.
