# Reference links (Further reading)

Add links that are helpful context for readers.

Guidelines:
- Keep links **optional**; the wiki should remain self-contained.
- Add a one-line note describing what the link is useful for.
- Do not treat external links as canonical source of truth unless explicitly stated.
