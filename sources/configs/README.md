# Config evidence (v0.13.2)

Place **minimal, relevant config files or redacted excerpts** here to back specific canonical documentation claims.

## What belongs here
- Runtime/config settings referenced by active docs
- Recipe/gating evidence snippets (when documented)
- Difficulty/mode toggle evidence (when documented)

## What does NOT belong here
- Modpack ZIPs, mod JARs, or any redistributed binaries
- Vanilla/proprietary assets (textures/models/sounds)
- Huge dumps of unrelated configs

## Naming convention
Use descriptive filenames that match what the page claims depend on, e.g.
- `worldgen_ores.toml`
- `mode_flags.toml`
- `recipe_overrides.zs`

If a file contains personal paths/usernames, redact them first.
