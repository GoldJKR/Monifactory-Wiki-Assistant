# Start Here (Planned Content Expansion)

Last Updated: 2026-02-21  
Status: Planned

## TL;DR checklist
- Run the local site and confirm `/` and `/dashboard` load.
- Review `docs/PRD.md` for implemented vs planned boundaries.
- Review `docs/WBS.md` and choose one unblocked story.
- Execute one bounded run and record evidence in `docs/DELIVERY-LOG.md`.

## Why this matters

This page provides the first step in planned content expansion (`WBS 3.1.1`) while preserving the current technical governance model.

## Steps (concrete, bounded)

1. Open the docs index at `docs/index.md` and confirm access to PRD, WBS, and execution policy.
2. Use `docs/PRD.md` to identify whether your target work is implemented baseline or planned scope.
3. Select one unblocked story from `docs/WBS.md` and map it to a queue in `docs/EXECUTION.md`.
4. Apply one bounded change set and validate against the mapped gate (`T#`).
5. Log the run using the standardized evidence fields in `docs/DELIVERY-LOG.md`.

## Common mistakes

- Treating planned items as implemented behavior.
- Executing multiple stories in one run.
- Omitting `Validation Output` or `Evidence Artifacts` in delivery entries.
- Updating changelog without `WBS ID` and `Run ID` for autonomous runs.
