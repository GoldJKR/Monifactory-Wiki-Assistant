# Content System (Canonical)

Last Updated: 2026-02-21
Status: Active

## Information Architecture (Compact)
- Implemented: canonical six-file documentation hub under `docs/`.
- Implemented: external/supporting sources under `sources/`.
- Planned: gameplay content expansion paths and onboarding/progression clusters.

## Authoring Template (Use Per Page)
- TL;DR checklist
- Why this matters
- Steps (concrete, bounded)
- Common mistakes
- Next links
- Further reading (optional)

Template usage note:
- Apply this template to newly authored content pages as they are introduced.

## Writing Rules
- Prefer verified claims; mark uncertain claims as unverified.
- Keep instructions short, imperative, and player-safe.
- Favor bullets/tables over long prose.
- Keep links purposeful and avoid dead-end pages.

## Cross-linking Rules
- Every page includes 2-6 next links.
- Avoid link overload; split pages when dense.
- Link to core path pages when introducing prerequisites.

## Content Readiness Gate
- Core canonical docs must be internally consistent and traceable to repository artifacts.
- Planned content pages may remain placeholders if owner + exit condition are declared.
- Placeholders must not present speculative instructions as verified facts.

## Alignment Notes
- `PRD.md` defines implemented vs planned content scope boundaries.
- `docs/archive/prd_v6.md` remains historical reference content.
